**TableProgressTracking** is a MediaWiki extension that allows users to track their progress against a certain criteria - such as whether they have earned an achievement, games played in a video game series, etc. This is done through checking off rows in a table. These are tracked and will be shown when the user next visits the page.

This extension requires MediaWiki 1.43. Usage instructions can be found on the following two articles: [MediaWiki.org](https://mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:TableProgressTracking) & [Telepedia Meta](https://meta.telepedia.net/wiki/TableProgressTracking).

> Note: This extension may be unstable (or completely broken) on PHP 8.4 due to usage of DOMXPath.
